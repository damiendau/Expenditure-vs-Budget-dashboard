This is a dashboard I created during my internship at KPMG for a client of the company. I anonymized all the data for privacy reasons. This dashboard gives insights of the expenditures of each employee compared to the initial budget that was allocated to them. Expenditures details are in the dépenses_anonymisées.xlsx file and the repartition of the budget lies in the Budget.xlsx file.
The dashboard itself is the .pbix file. You can filter the data displayed on the fiscal period, the employees and the expenditure type. If you want the details on a specific point of the data, you should select the concerned data in a visualization, and then CTRL + left click on the ">> EXTRAIRE <<" button.
